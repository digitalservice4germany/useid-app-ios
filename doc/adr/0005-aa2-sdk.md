# 5. Switch from Open eCard Framework to AusweisApp2 SDK as eID-Kernel

Date: 2023-03-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

During the development of our eID-Client, we encountered several issues with the Open eCard Framework, which we initially selected as the eID-Kernel. These issues directly impacted the user experience, hindering our goal of providing a seamless and user-friendly interface.

## Decision

After careful evaluation of the user experience issues and available alternatives, we have decided to transition from the Open eCard Framework to the AusweisApp2 SDK as the eID-Kernel for our eID-Client. By making this transition, we aim to resolve the existing issues and deliver an improved user experience.

## Consequences

1. Improved User Experience: The transition to the AusweisApp2 SDK addresses the issues that were negatively impacting the user experience. By leveraging the capabilities of the AusweisApp2 SDK, we can provide a more reliable, stable, and intuitive eID-Client interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

2. Learning Curve and Development Effort: The transition to a new eID-Kernel requires the development team to familiarize themselves with the AusweisApp2 SDK and adapt their implementation accordingly.

3. Testing: The switch to the AusweisApp2 SDK necessitates testing of the updated implementation. It is important to thoroughly validate the functionality, security, and compatibility of the eID-Client with the new eID-Kernel to ensure a reliable and stable system.

4. Limited Control of In-Progress and Error Messages: One downside of using the AusweisApp2 SDK is that it provides limited control over in-progress and error messages. This restricts our ability to customize and tailor the user experience during certain interactions.

5. Flow Cancellation during NFC Card Scanning: Another limitation of the AusweisApp2 SDK is that the entire flow is canceled if the user cancels the NFC card scanning process. This behavior does not align with our desired user experience, as it disrupts the flow and may lead to user frustration.

6. Complex Codebase of the SDK: The AusweisApp2 SDKâ€™s complex codebase may pose challenges when investigating and debugging issues. This complexity can increase the time and effort required to troubleshoot and resolve issues.

## Alternatives Considered

1. One alternative would be to address the issues within the Open eCard Framework. However, the maintainers of the framework did not prioritize the issues we encountered, and obtaining their support for the necessary changes would be challenging. Patching the framework on our own would require extensive modifications to the existing codebase. Given the severity of the issues and their impact on the user experience, we concluded that transitioning to a different eID-Kernel would provide a more practical and comprehensive solution.

2. Another alternative considered was to develop our own implementation of low-level interactions with the eID card and services. However, this approach would require significant time, expertise, and resources to ensure proper functionality, security, and compliance with standards. Moreover, it may divert our focus from the primary objective of delivering a user-friendly interface.

## Decision Outcome

The decision to transition from the Open eCard Framework to the AusweisApp2 SDK as the eID-Kernel has been accepted. By making this transition, we prioritize resolving the user experience issues that were impacting the eID-Client. Although there may be a learning curve and testing efforts involved, the long-term benefits justify the decision.
