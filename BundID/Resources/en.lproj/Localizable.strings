"accessibility_text" = "## Accessibility Statement\n\nThe BundesIdent app seeks to ensure that the app is accessible free of any barriers in compliance with the provisions of the German Federal Disability Equality Act (BGG) and the German Barrier-Free Information Technology Ordinance (BITV 2.0) in the implementation of Directive (EU) 2016/2102. This Accessibility Statement applies to version 1.0.0, which is currently available in the App Store. The Statement was drafted on 9 September 2022.\n\nThis Statement emanates from a self-assessment based on the current draft of the BIK BITV test for mobile apps ([github.com/BIK-BITV/BIK-App-Test ↗](https://github.com/BIK-BITV/BIK-App-Test)). In the near future, we are planning to have the app externally audited.\n\n### How barrier-free is the service?\n\nThis app has been newly developed. The shortcomings listed below are being worked on.\nThe BundesIdent app is also to be developed continuously in the coming weeks based on future auditing and feedback from users.\n\n### Which areas are not barrier-free?\n\nWe have set ourselves the objective of rectifying problems as quickly as possible. The following incompatibilities with BITV 2.0 exist in the current version:\n\n- We do not support dark mode at present (test step 11.7).\n- Landscape format is currently not supported (test step 11.1.3.4).\n- An error message in case of incorrect PIN entry (transport PIN as well as personal PIN) are not proactively read out (test step 11.5.2.11).\n- There is no direct labeling of PIN entries in the input field. This only takes place in the title of the screens (test step 11.3.3.2).\n- An unexpected change in context occurs at two points during entry of the personal PIN (test step 11.3.2.2).\n- The transport PIN input cannot be zoomed to 200%% (test step 11.1.4.4).\n- The headings are not marked as such (test step 11.1.3.1).\n- We do not offer a second support channel (test step 12.2.3). Currently, we can only provide support via e-mail at [eid@digitalservice.bund.de ↗](mailto:eid@digitalservice.bund.de).\n\n### Contact and feedback possibility\n\nHave you noticed any deficiencies in barrier-free access to content? If so, please feel free to contact us at: [eid@digitalservice.bund.de ↗](mailto:eid@digitalservice.bund.de).\n\n### Arbitration\n\nThe Federal Government's Commissioner for Matters relating to Persons with Disabilities has a conciliation body pursuant to § 16 of the German Federal Disability Equality Act (BGG). The conciliation board is assigned the task of resolving conflicts between persons with disabilities and federal public agencies. You can call upon the conciliation board if you are not satisfied with the answers from the above contact option. The aim is not to determine winners or losers. Rather, the goal is to find a solution to a problem jointly and out of court with the help of the conciliation board. The conciliation procedure is free of charge. Nor do you need any legal counsel. You will find all the information relating to the conciliation procedure on the website of the conciliation board. There you can read how a conciliation procedure works and how to submit an application for conciliation. You can also submit an application in plain language or in German sign language.\n\nYou can contact the conciliation board at the following address:\n\nConciliation Board under the German Federal Disability Equality Act (BGG) at the Federal Government's Commissioner for Matters relating to Persons with Disabilities\\\nMauerstraße 53\\\n10117 Berlin\\\nPhone: [+49 (0)30 18 527 2805](tel:+4930 18 527 2805) \n\nE-Mail:\\\n[info@schlichtungsstelle-bgg.de ↗](mailto:info@schlichtungsstelle-bgg.de)\n\nInternet:\\\n[www.schlichtungsstelle-bgg.de ↗](https://www.schlichtungsstelle-bgg.de)";

"privacy_text" = "## Data Privacy Policy\n\nStatus: 09 September 2022\n\n### Who are we?\n\nThe BundesIdent app is developed and operated by the Federal Government's DigitalService GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Home Affairs (BMI).\n\nDigitalService is a federal limited liability company (GmbH). The Federal Republic of Germany holds 100 percent of the shares in the GmbH. Our aim and objective: services that work better for everyone. Government services should be just as easy for everyone to access and use as other digital products that we use regularly at work and in everyday life. That is why users and their needs are consistently at the heart of our product development work. We bring together teams with expertise in software development, design and product management with the public administration. Together with those offices and persons in charge in the public administration and with the involvement of citizens, we build digital solutions that are user-centered, modern, and which nurture trust and confidence.\n\n[digitalservice.bund.de ↗](https://digitalservice.bund.de)\n\n### Who are your contacts?\n\nQuestions involving data protection matters can be sent to the data protection officer in charge of BundesIdent:\n\n#### Responsible organization\n\nThe data protection officer in charge of the app is\n\nDigitalService GmbH des Bundes\\\nPrinzessinnenstraße 8-14\\\n10969 Berlin\\\nCommercial Register: HRB 212879 B\\\nRegister Court: Charlottenburg\n\nRepresented by:\\\nMs. Christina Lang\\\nE-Mail:\\\n[datenschutz@digitalservice.bund.de ↗](mailto:datenschutz@digitalservice.bund.de)\n\n### How is identification performed in the app?\nPersonal data is neither stored nor determined in the app. Simply put, the BundesIdent app functions as a card reader. You can use the German ID card, a German electronic residence permit or, for persons with EU citizenship and nationals of the European Economic Area, the eID card as an identification card. By requesting your personal PIN in combination with verification of the existence of your ID card via an NFC interface, only the release of the personal data is verified and either confirmed or rejected. NFC stands for Near Field Communication. The technology enables an exchange of data over very short distances. It is also used, for example, when making payment using a smartphone at the supermarket checkout.\n\nThe verification of your personal data takes place via a so-called eID server. This is accessed by the respective application service.\\\nAuthorization certificates are managed and revocation lists are maintained on the eID server. The eID server performs secure communication with the BundesIdent app and the ID card and forwards the read-out data to the application service. The eID server establishes the authenticity and validity of the ID card, checks whether it has been blocked by the cardholder, and transmits the personal data to the other systems of the application service.\\\nThe application service must ensure that the personal data that is transmitted is processed in a manner that is compliant with data protection regulations.\n\n### What personal data do we process?\n\nIf you contact us at the email address provided in the App Store or on the support website ([eid@digitalservice.bund.de ↗](mailto:eid@digitalservice.bund.de)), you must at least provide us with your email address and possibly other information that you disclose in your email. In order for us to process your request, we need to process this data. The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is Art. 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). \n\nNo personal data is stored or forwarded in the app for identification in the app. If the personal PIN matches with the ID card, authorization takes place and forwarded to the eID server. The eID server, which is in the domain of responsibility of the Federal Government, receives the verified authorization and forwards the personal data stored there to the service you are using. Forwarding of the personal data from the eID server takes place under the responsibility of the Federal Government. The data stored there cannot be viewed by us as a DigitalService and is not stored or processed in the BundesIdent App. \n\n### Under what circumstances may we share your data with third parties?\n\nWe do not transfer your personal data to third parties for any purposes other than those listed in the following. We only disclose your personal data to third parties if:\n\n- you have provided your express consent to such,\n- disclosure is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding interest worthy of protection in the non-disclosure of your data,\n- in the event that there is a legal obligation to perform disclosure, and\n- this is legally permissible and necessary for the processing of a contractual relationship with you.\n\n### How long and where do we store your data?\nNo personal data is stored at DigitalService in connection with the BundesIdent App.\n\nWe store your e-mails and contacts for as long as is necessary to process your request and then store this data for a maximum period of 12 months in case you contact us again with reference to your original question.\n\n### Are app analytics services used?\nTo further develop and analyze the app, we use an application monitoring and error tracking software called sentry. This does not collect any personal data, nor does it use cookies. Crashes and errors by the app are evaluated. For this purpose, sentry processes the following data:\n\n- Device type\n- Operating system version\n- App version\n- Pseudonym: this is created by sentry\n\nFor more information about sentry and data processing, please see\n\n[sentry.io/privacy ↗](https://sentry.io/privacy/)\n\nWe use Matomo (formerly Piwik) to analyze user friendliness. This is a service provided by InnoCraft Ltd, 150 Willis St, 6011 Wellington, New Zealand, NZBN 6106769, (\"Matomo\") by means of cookie technology. The Matomo service is used solely to optimize the BundesIdent app to provide a better user experience. For this purpose, we use the following anonymized information that is stored exclusively in the European Economic Area:\n\nMatomo processes the following data within the app::\n\n- A randomly generated user ID that is created anew for each session. A new session starts after 30 minutes of user inactivity.\n- Information about screens displayed in the app\n- Information about the operating system, device and application information (version, model, screen resolution, etc.) for an optimized application and to ensure data security\n- Information on whether an event has been successfully completed as well as error events (e.g., wrong pin entered, badge deactivated).\n- For more information on Matomo's terms of use and data protection provisions, visit:\n\n[matomo.org/privacy ↗](https://matomo.org/privacy/)\n\n### What rights do you have (right to information, right to object, etc.)?\n\nYou have various rights under the General Data Protection Regulation. Details emanate in particular from Articles 15 to 18 and 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation.\n\n#### Right to information\n\nYou can request information about your personal data processed by us. In your request for information, you should be specific in your request in order to make it easier for us to compile the necessary data. Therefore, if possible, you should provide information on the specific process step in the request.\n\n#### Right to rectification\n\nIf the information concerning you is not (or no longer) correct, you can request that it be rectified. If your data is incomplete, you can request that it be completed.\n\n#### Right to erasure\n\nYou can request the erasure of your personal data. Your right to erasure depends, among other things, on whether the data concerning you is still needed by us to fulfill our legal duties.\n\n#### Right to restriction of processing\n\nYou have the right to request restriction of the processing of data concerning you.\n\n#### Right to object\n\nYou have the right to object to the processing of data relating to you at any time on grounds relating to your particular situation.\n\n#### Right to file a complaint\n\nIf you believe that we have not addressed your concerns or have not addressed them fully, you may file a complaint with our Privacy Officer as well as the Federal Privacy and Information Security Commissioner.\n\n**External Data Protection Officer of DigitalService GmbH des Bundes**\n\n1000 Elephants GmbH\\\nBjörn Stecher\\\n[datenschutz@digitalservice.bund.de ↗](mailto:datenschutz@digitalservice.bund.de)\n\n**German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information**\n\nGraurheindorfer Str. 153 - 53117 Bonn\n\nPhone: [+49 (0)228-997799-0](tel:+49228-997799-0)\n\nFax: [+49 (0)228-997799-5550](tel:+49228-997799-5550)\n\nE-Mail: [poststelle@bfdi.bund.de ↗](mailto:poststelle@bfdi.bund.de)\n\nDe-Mail: [poststelle@bfdi.de-mail.de ↗](mailto:poststelle@bfdi.de-mail.de)\n\n**Online complaint**\n\n[www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Service/Beschwerden/beschwerden_node.html ↗](https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Service/Beschwerden/beschwerden_node.html)";
