# About the project

Securely identify yourself with our app and your ID card anytime, anywhere without video calls and waiting times.

With this Project we aim to develop the state digital identity into a popular and widespread solution - recognised by service providers and citizens.

Digital identification is one of the basic functions necessary for the successful implementation of digital citizen services. For this reason, it must be accessible and usable for all citizens. In this way, we will contribute to increasing the usage rates of digital citizen services.

In our MVP we develop an eID-interface based on the eID-technology to enable the digital identification with the German ID card. From there it will be evolving based on our usersâ€™ needs.
